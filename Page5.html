  <h1><b>1) Explain the main purpose of an operating system?</b></h1>

    <b> 

Operating systems exist for two main purposes. One is that it is designed to make sure a computer system performs well by managing its computational activities. Another is that it provides an environment for the development and execution of programs.<b>

  <h1><b>   2) Wht is the diffrance Between Open Source and Closed Source Software ?</b></h1>

    <li><a>Open source software (OSS) refers to the software which uses the code freely available on the Internet.  The code can be copied, modified or deleted by other users and organizations. As the software is open to the public, the result is that it constantly updates, improves and expands as more people can work on its improvement.</a></li>


    <li><a>Closed source software (CSS) is opposite to OSS and means the software which uses the proprietary and closely guarded code. Only the original authors of software can access, copy, and alter that software. In a case with closed source software, you are not purchasing the software, but only pay to use it.</a></li>
