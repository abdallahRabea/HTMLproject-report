An OS is software that interfaces the end-user with the hardware of the computer. To run other programs, every machine must have at least one OS. An app such as Chrome, MS Word, Games etc needs an environment in which its task can be executed and carried out. The OS enables you to communicate without knowing how to speak the language of your computer. Without an operating system , the user can not use any computer or mobile device.
